        "It should be noted that the dataset that was presented in the previous article had uneven distribution of true and false cases. In particular, the dataset had 268 true cases and 500 false cases of diabetese. Details on the dataset can be found in the following link: \n",

Furthermore, the training and testing of the model should be done in different sets. Therefore, the data set will be divided into 4 such sets, and one set will be used to train, whereas the remainings are used for testing the model.\n",
